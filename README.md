First, install NeoVim 0.7

Copy the nvim directory to ~/.config

Start nvim, a bunch of plugins should auto install.

Close and restart nvim. You should see treesitter installing a bunch of languages.

`init.lua` initializes each individual plugin config. Plugins are configured in their respective .lua files.

See [NeoVim from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctH-a-1eUME) video series for a walkthrough on how to customize plugin configs.
